# HiPore-C
We developed a protocol of in situ high throughput multi-way contact long read Pore-C sequencing (in situ HiPore-C), a strategy that integrated multi-fragment ligates preparation with third-generation sequencing technology. With HiPore-C approach, we could explore higher-order chromatin interaction genome-widely.
